# ESP-Miner_Shares_Check
ESP-Miner Shares Check

A small Python scrypt that continuously checks the counts of accepted shares from the Bitaxe at preset time interval.

If the number of accepted shares are not increasing, it will restart the Bitaxe.

It works with the latest version of ESP-miner from skot (https://github.com/skot/ESP-Miner)
